## Summary
In this challenge, I was tasked with using Python and the Unsupervised Learning processes I learned in class to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. This was completed in a few steps. This included data preparation, finding the optimal K value for clustering, clustering cryptocurrencies with original data, and optimizing the clusters with PCA. Finally I was able to make some conclusions on the data provided. 

## Technologies Used 
* Python
* Unsupervised Learning
* Visual Studio Code


## Sources
* Used a number of different sources when stuck. These include StackOverflow, GitHub and class notes.
